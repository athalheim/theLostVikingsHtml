 Can such a game be developed
    and played using only
       HTML/Javascript
             ?
             
 Here is the proof of concept
   Note: Only what is needed for the proof of concept is included in this package.
         See the Python modules in 'theLostVikings_Python' for tools to get the remaining data.
 
 What has been done:
  -Splash screens:
    Esc:  Skips entirely the splash screens and open the game selection screen

  -Basic scene display:
    +/-:  Increase/decrease screen size
    S:    Toggle sound
    M:    Toggle Music

  -Scene Manager Module:
    P:    Pause/Resume game
    Q:    Quit game

  -Scenes 1 and 2:
    From the images, build locations and areas
    to confine character movements

  -Vikings module:
    Control key: Switch character
    Movements: 
     -Left-right: floors, float, fall
     -Up/down: ladders
     -Fall (all)
     -Jump (Erik)
     -Float (Olaf, anti-G)
     
  -Characters: Erik, Baleog and Olaf:
    Access primary ability

  -Balloons:
    Display dialogs, information, etc...

  -Sprites:
    Initialize,
    Cycle for action
    Draw sprite

  -Collectibles:
    Draw collectible
    
  
 What remains to do:
   Animate characters: Erik, Baleog and Olaf:
   Access secondary ability
   Activate controls
   Access and use inventory
   Scenes 3 to 37:
      Build scenes

Enjoy!
